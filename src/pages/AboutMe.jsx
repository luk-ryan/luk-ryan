          Hi, my name is Ryan Luk. I am currently in my last year of studying
          Computer Science at York University. One of the most satisfying things
          for me is when I am able to understand complicated concepts and solve
          complex problems. I also really enjoy learning new things in general,
          which many of my hobbies/interests are centered around. My main
          interests outside of programming include playing piano and karate.
          Recently, I've been learning tricking, which is like a combination of
          gymnastics tumbling, martial art kicks, and flips.
        </p>
        <h2>Education</h2>
        <p>
          First, I will go over some of the course I've completed and different
          topics I've learned
        </p>
        <h3>Algorithms</h3>
        <p>
          In third year, I took an algorithms course. I learned the steps to
          solving problems using various algorithms, such as greedy algorithms,
          recursive backtracking, and dynamic programming. We explored how
          exactly each of these algorithms worked, as well as the efficiency of
          each one, using it as a metric to compare them to one another.
        </p>
        <h3>Data Structures</h3>
        <p>
          In second year, I learned about the fundamental data structures, like
          arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, and trees. This helped build my
          foundation for understanding algorithms in my later years. We explored
          common basic algorithms that would use each data structure, as well as
          which situations would call for certain data structures.
        </p>

        <h3>Advanced Object-Oriented Programming</h3>
        <p>
          Another second year course where I built my foundation in OOP and the
          Java programming language. Here, I learned about the structure of java
          projects with classes, and objects. I was able to understand
          fundamental concepts, such as methods, inheritance, polymorphism, and
          generic classes. Because of this course, one of my most comfortable
          programming languages is Java.
        </p>

        <h3>Other</h3>
        <p>Here are other concepts/courses I've studied: </p>
        <p>
          <ul>
            <li>Operating System Fundamentals</li>
            <li>Database Management Systems</li>
            <li>Software Design</li>
            <li>User Interfaces</li>
            <li>Discrete Mathematics and Logic for Computer Science</li>
            <li>Statistics</li>
          </ul>
        </p>

        <h2>Hobbies and Interests</h2>
        <h3>Piano</h3>
        <p>
          I started learning piano when I was four, beginning with group lessons
          and then moving to one-on-one sessions as I followed the Royal
          Conservatory of Music (RCM) program. This curriculum goes from levels
          1-10, each with a practical exam to advance and theory exams required
          from level 8 onward. I worked through all 10 levels with my teacher’s
          help, finishing up in my first year of university. Now, I keep
          exploring new pieces and play for fun in my free time.
        </p>
        <h3>Karate</h3>
        <p>
          I started karate when I was around eight, moving up through each belt
          level from white to black belt in about three years. Many people stop
          after their first-degree black belt, but I kept training and earned my
          second-degree belt after five years. As one of the older, more
          advanced students, the dojo owner noticed my commitment and offered me
          a chance to start teaching. I began as a volunteer and eventually
          became an instructor in high school, making it my first job. Now, as a
          fourth-degree black belt and senior instructor, I continue training
          and coaching students for competitions. This year, I'm also preparing
          for my first tournament and working hard on my own fitness.
        </p>
        <h3>Tricking</h3>
        <p>
          Tricking is a mix of martial arts, gymnastics, kicks, and flips, all
          in one sport. I discovered it a couple of years ago at a parkour gym
          called The Monkey Vault. Initially, I wanted to train for stunts—I’ve
          always admired my cousin, who works as a stunt double, and thought it
          could be a unique career path. But after watching trickers pull off
          impressive combos, I decided to focus on tricking instead. I also
          had the idea of teaching it as a new martial arts style at the dojo
          where I currently instruct.
        </p>
        <p>
          When I first started tricking, I picked up the basics quickly—even the
          beginner tricks are challenging! Unfortunately, about a year in, I
          fractured my big toe, which meant taking a three-month break from
          training. The injury slowed my progress, affecting not only my
          physical recovery but also my confidence in tricks that involve going
          upside down. Since getting back, I've been working hard to overcome
          this mental block and continue progressing with more advanced moves.
          My goal is to keep pushing forward and eventually bring tricking into
          the dojo where I teach.
